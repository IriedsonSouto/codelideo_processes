You will be asked to create a set of 20 code review task instructions according to the model shown as an example. These task instructions will be provided to a GPT model, and we will evaluate the GPT model for completing the instructions.

Here are the requirements:

1. Try not to repeat the instructions to maximize diversity.
2. Try to focus on instructions that encompass similar types of problems as presented in the example.
3. The new instructions should be in Java language.
4. The instructions should be in English.
5. Ensure that the code review instructions are relevant and correct.
6. The generated data can be applied in a fine-tuning process, so generate instructions that can be useful for such a purpose.

Example to be followed:
